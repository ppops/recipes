            <p class="line">Preheat the oven to 160 degrees. Grease and line a 28 cm cake tin. Place the polenta, ground pistachios and baking powder in a large bowl. Combine and set aside. Cut the butter into chunks and beat with the sugar for about 5 minutes until it is light and fluffy. Add the eggs and beat for a few more minutes. Add the lime zest and juice to the bowl of dry ingredients and then fold in the egg/sugar/butter mixture until it is well combined. Place the mixture into the prepared tin, flattening it with a spatula and cook on the bottom shelf of the oven for at least an hour (it might be more, depending on your oven). The cake is cooked when a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Place on a wire rack to cool before removing the cake tin.</p><p class="line">To prepare the frosting – whizz the cream cheese, icing sugar, lime zest, lime juice and cornflour (if using) with a stick blender until well incorporated. Apply the frosting to the cake (once it has cooled completely) using a spatula and a butter knife to ensure it is evenly spread. This cake will keep in the fridge, covered, for at least five days (but it won’t last that long!)</p>

            <p>I have a friend who says “I don’t cook vegan, gluten free, lactose free, low fat or low salt”. I think he is joking (possibly…) though I can agree that it is more challenging when you are cooking for a dinner party and you need to work around food intolerances (or lifestyle and health choices). However I have both close friends and family members who eat gluten free, so although I can’t show off my home made pasta when I have them over for dinner, I can certainly make a delicious gluten free dessert. My post with the recipe for a flourless orange cake has proven to be one of my most popular, so there are clearly lots of folk in the blogosphere looking for gluten free or flourless cake alternatives.</p><p>Almond meal is used frequently in Italian cakes however pistachio meal is less common. I love it as it makes the cake look green. At the Collingwood Children’s Farmers Market this weekend, I found some Australian pesticide free pistachios from Wedderburn. I thought they would balance beautifully with limes, which I had managed to pick up cheaply (a dozen for $5) at the local supermaket. Limes are a zesty and delicious addition that balances beautifully with the pistachios. I proudly (or stupidly) combined them in a flourless cake ~ stupidly because Melbourne has been scorching with 9 days in a row over 32 degrees and having the oven on for over an hour was quite hellish. The result was rather good, my husband proclaiming it was his new favorite cake. I also made some cream cheese frosting with limes – seeing as I had so many. This may seem rather excessive – a simple dusting of icing sugar would have done nicely. But I thought if I had to bake a cake in this extreme heat, I might as well make it amazing! Some good friends came over on Sunday night and we had some with some chilled Tasmanian Botrytis Rielsing. Just delicious.</p>
