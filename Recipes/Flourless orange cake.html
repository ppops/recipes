Beat the eggs with the sugar until well combined. Add the orange puree and continue beating until the mixture is homogeneous. Now add the almond meal and baking powder – some recipes say to fold the final ingredients in – I used my KitchenAid for the lot and it worked out fine. Place the cake mixture in a greased and lined tin with a removable base. Place in the oven and bake for 50 – 55 minutes until the cake is golden on top and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.</p><p class="line">Place on a cooling rack and allow to cool before placing some icing sugar on the top using a fine sieve.

            <p>I love how oranges brighten up a cold winter. Beautiful tangy oranges are a must in my kitchen during winter – not only because they brighten the place up, but also because you can have them with so many meals in the day – squeezed as orange juice for breakfast, grated zest with red beetroot gnocchi for lunch and whole in flourless orange cake for afternoon tea.</p><p>This much loved and much cooked flourless orange cake is made with 2 oranges, boiled whole for a couple of hours and then placed – skin, pips and all – into a blender. The resultant smooth orange puree is added to eggs, sugar, almonds, baking powder – a total of 5 ingredients. It doesn’t get much simpler than that. It is great to have a recipe that is suitable for your gluten free friends as well.</p><p>I have made it with blood red oranges and it is just as nice as using regular oranges, though if they are less sweet you may need to adjust the sugar. I love how blood oranges are available in Australia – back in the early 1970s and I was a little girl living in Italy, I was rather skeptical of red orange juice which my aunt would squeeze for me. It was clearly the wrong colour. However I grew up to know better – just because they are called oranges, it doesn’t mean they have to be orange.</p><p>This is a dense and moist cake that will keep for a week – I keep it in the fridge – I think it gets better with age! I serve it dusted with icing sugar and with a large dollop of mascarpone or creme fraiche. When you are having a bad day (and life gives you lemons), bake a flourless orange cake.</p>
