You can make the meatballs any size you like. Once they are rolled, dip them briefly in a small bowl of water. This helps them stick together, then set aside.</p><p class="line">Chop the onion finely and cook over low-medium heat in a large frypan in some olive oil until translucent (will take about ten minutes). Place the meatballs one at a time in the frypan, and cook about 4 minutes on one side then turn them over and cook for a few more minutes until they are nicely browned all over. Turn up the heat to medium-high and add the wine. Cook for a few minutes until the wine has evaporated. Reduce the heat to low and add the tinned tomatoes and the passata. Cover the own with a lid and cook for at least 30 minutes on low heat, checking several times to make sure the meatballs are not sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p><p class="line">Serve with pasta, mashed potatoes or eat it as I did, with bread to mop up the sauce. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley leaves if you like.</p>

            <p>I have been spending lots of time with my mother since she has been unwell. One of the things I have most enjoyed doing is cooking for her. After so many years of her making amazing Italian food for me, it is now my turn to give back. Yesterday I made meatballs, using her recipe. Not that it is written down anywhere – but it is the one that comes to her without really thinking too hard.</p><p>She recited the ingredients to me as she sat down in the kitchen and watched me preparing. After a few minutes, she could not help herself and asked me to get her apron. Then she started helping out whilst sitting at the kitchen table. She minced the garlic and I added it to the beef. She chopped the parsley and then asked me for the bowl of ingredients. Next she insisted on mixing everything in the bowl, using her hands, telling me by feel, whether the mixture needed more dry or wet ingredients. She has always been such an instinctive cook – no one taught her – she has always seemed to know what to do to make a dish work. And at 85, she is still able to do it!</p><p>Meatballs (polpette in Italian) are a family favorite and so easy to make. When I make these at home, I substitute the bread for the gluten free variety so my daughter can eat them. Mamma’s recipe for meatballs is delicious – the addition of nutmeg and parmigiano make them so tasty. They are simple, comforting, warming and taste just like home. They are perfect served with pasta, mashed potato or even just with crusty bread, to mop up the rich tomato sauce. Buon appetito!</p>
